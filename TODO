### UP FOR GRABS

Tests
- Use standard tests.

Crypto stuff:
- kFromMessage
- Check all the tweak instructions.

Better handling of corrupt blocks.
- Kill DB & restart.

Network:
- Crypto on network. TLS?
- Make work with IPv6

CLI client
- Implement CLI option "--help".

General:
- Better logging.
  - Colours.
- Move over to new system.
- Remove block chain on protocol change (i.e. store protocol with block chain).


Robustness
- Remove aborts
- Recover from all exceptions.

### Gav

For PoC2:
- Use mining state for nonce.

Network:
- NotInChain will be very bad for new peers - it'll run through until the genesis.
  - Check how many it has first.

BUG: need to discard transactions if nonce too old, even when not mining.

### Marko

Ubuntu builds
- Raring (branch, local, x64 only :-( )
- Quantal (branch) (Launchpad)
- Saucy (master) (Launchpad)

### Alex

Mac build.

### Eric

Windows XC build.

### Tim/Harv

Windows MSVC build.

LATER:

Trie on DB.
- Move the restore point stuff into block restore points
  - i.e. keep all nodes from last 127 blocks with counter, at 128, kill but keep every (60*24*7)th or so i.e. one per week as a restore point.
  - maybe allow this to be configured.


### TIM

Stateful Miner class.

Better Mod-Exp.
